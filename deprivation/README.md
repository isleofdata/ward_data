| Index of Multiple Deprivation | 2015 | Best-fit ward | Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government | The Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD), is the official measure of relative deprivation for small areas (Lower Super Output Areas or LSOAs) in England. It ranks every LSOA from 1  (most deprived) to 32,844 (least deprived). The LSOAs have then been aggregated to form best-fit wards to give an approximation of deprivation at ward level. | [view](data/index_of_multiple_deprivation.csv) | [view](code/index_of_multiple_deprivation.R) |
